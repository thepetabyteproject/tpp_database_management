# tpp_database_management
These python scripts create a tpp database, create collections following schemas, and perform insert operations. 
Contributers can contribute to update schema.py by following the exact pattern as given in the file.
For each collection there is a schema.
I have created schema for only dummy collections for demo purpose, so you can think of a real collection that will be required for the tpp database and then add schemas according to fields (keys in python dictionary).
